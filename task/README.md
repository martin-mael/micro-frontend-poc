# Task app buildable as web component

## How this app has been initialized?

This app has been initialized from create vite task, using the `react-swc-ts` template:
```shell
yarn create vite task --template react-swc-ts
```

Then react router has been added:
```
yarn add react-router-dom@6
```

## What is the intent?

We want to demonstrate here how to adapt a react app as a web component.
